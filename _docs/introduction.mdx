The main mission of Zenbu UI is a provide the easiest way to build a website. Sometimes dealing with CSS waste your time, and it's not simple to use CSS for some people. Zenbu UI provides you the convenience of applying your design system without CSS, just using the props.

Zenbu UI builds with Tailwind CSS as the utilities, cause of that we can make our component more flexible to customize. You can change the colors, borders, shadows, responsiveness, or whatever on our components.

## Key Features

### Accessible
We following the WAI-ARIA guidelines specifications and support keyboard navigation, and screen reader.

### Unstyled
Zenbu UI does not have any design system. You have the freedom to use any design system in the world. The basic style of Zenbu UI is a plain design.

### Utility Props
You can customize the design with the use of utility props not with CSS. It's easier to understand and all components have the same properties.

### Theming
You can customize the specific component with context. Just place the name of the component and make an object to style it.

### Semantic
We following the Semantic HTML guideline specifications.
