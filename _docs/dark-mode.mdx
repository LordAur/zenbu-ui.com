title: Dark Mode
description: Zenbu UI comes with a built-in dark mode and can be implemented on all components.
navigation: [{
  name: "Usage",
  link: "#usage"
}, {
  name: "Example",
  link: "#example"
}]
---

By default, all of the component Zenbu UI supported dark mode. No need for extra effort just use props like **darkColor** and **darkColorContrast**.

## Usage
To get dark mode you must wrap your main component with Provider and set the dark properties:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import 'your-project-folder/style.css'

export let toggleDarkMode: () => void
const App = () => {
  const [dark, setDark] = useState(false)
  toggleDarkMode = () => {
    setDark(!dark)
  }

  return(
    <Provider dark={dark}>
      <YourComponent />
    </Provider>
  )
}

export default App
```

## Example
We will give some examples of using dark mode. Here is an example of a dark mode on the button component.
But this doesn't only apply to the button component. You can use the same method for the other components.

<PreviewDarkMode />
<ExampleDarkMode />
