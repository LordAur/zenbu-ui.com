## Width
A value of width properties, you can use for all components.

<SizeWidth />

### Example Width
<SizeExampleWidth />

```jsx
<Box width="96" />

// You can use width and height properties for all components. //

<Button width="full" />
```

## Height
A value of height properties, you can use for all components.

<SizeHeight />

### Example Height
<SizeExampleHeight />

```jsx
<Box height="96" />

// You can use width and height properties for all components. //

<Button height="5" />
```

## Responsive
There are five breakpoints by default, inspired by common device resolutions:

<SizeResponsive />

To add a utility but only have it take effect at a certain breakpoint, all you need to do is use the breakpoint as a property like below:

### Example Responsive
<SizeExampleResponsive />

```jsx
<Card
width="full" lg={{ width: "1/2" }}
title={(
  <>
    <Text
    lg={{ fontSize: "xs" }}
    fontSize="sm" color="purple" colorContrast="600"
    darkColor="purple" darkColorContrast="600">
      Furniture
    </Text>

    <Text
    lg={{ fontSize: "base" }}
    fontSize="xl" fontWeight="semibold" color="slate" colorContrast="700"
    darkColor="slate" darkColorContrast="700">
      Black and Brown Wooden Chair
    </Text>
  </>
)}
description={( ... )}
footer={( ... )} />
```
See the example above, it uses the card component where it uses the **lg** breakpoint to change the width of the component. If the screen size is 1024px or bigger, the width of card component is 1/2 (width: 50%;) and will change to width 100% when the screen size less than 1024px.

The card component also shows a breakpoint to change the text size. Look at the title, when the breakpoint is **lg** the font size is small and if the screen size will be shrink, the font size will be bigger.

These works to set **width**, **height**, **font size**, **text align**, **flex**, **gap**, and **spacing**.
