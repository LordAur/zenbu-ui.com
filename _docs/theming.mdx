By default, all of the components of Zenbu UI have a plain design. You can customize the component with two methods. You can customize the component with properties or you can customize with **Provider**.

You just need to use the component type and specify the component name to give the design you want.

Here is an example of how you can change the design of a component with a **Provider**:

<PreviewTheming />

```jsx
import { Provider } from '@zenbu-ui/provider'

const App = () => {
  return(
    <Provider dark={false}
    theme={{
      button: {
        "red-button": {
          color: "red",
          colorContrast: "600"
        },
        "emerald-button": {
          color: "emerald",
          colorContrast: "500"
        }
      }
    }}>
      <Button componentName="red-button">Button</Button>
      <Button componentName="emerald-button">Button</Button>
    </Provider>
  )
}

export default App
```
